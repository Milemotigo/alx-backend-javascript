Tasks
0. Basic list of objects
mandatory
Create a function named getListStudents that returns an array of objects.

Each object should have three attributes: id (Number), firstName (String), and location (String).

The array contains the following students in order:

Guillaume, id: 1, in San Francisco
James, id: 2, in Columbia
Serena, id: 5, in San Francisco
bob@dylan:~$ cat 0-main.js
import getListStudents from "./0-get_list_students.js";

console.log(getListStudents());

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 0-main.js 
[
  { id: 1, firstName: 'Guillaume', location: 'San Francisco' },
  { id: 2, firstName: 'James', location: 'Columbia' },
  { id: 5, firstName: 'Serena', location: 'San Francisco' }
]
bob@dylan:~$ 
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-backend-javascript
Directory: 0x03-ES6_data_manipulation
File: 0-get_list_students.js
  
1. More mapping
mandatory
Create a function getListStudentIds that returns an array of ids from a list of object.

This function is taking one argument which is an array of objects - and this array is the same format as getListStudents from the previous task.

If the argument is not an array, the function is returning an empty array.

You must use the map function on the array.

bob@dylan:~$ cat 1-main.js
import getListStudentIds from "./1-get_list_student_ids.js";
import getListStudents from "./0-get_list_students.js";

console.log(getListStudentIds("hello"));
console.log(getListStudentIds(getListStudents()));

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 1-main.js 
[]
[ 1, 2, 5 ]

GitHub repository: alx-backend-javascript

File: 1-get_list_student_ids.js
  
2. Filter
mandatory
Create a function getStudentsByLocation that returns an array of objects who are located in a specific city.

It should accept a list of students (from getListStudents) and a city (string) as parameters.

You must use the filter function on the array.

bob@dylan:~$ cat 2-main.js
import getListStudents from "./0-get_list_students.js";
import getStudentsByLocation from "./2-get_students_by_loc.js";

const students = getListStudents();

console.log(getStudentsByLocation(students, 'San Francisco'));

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev 2-main.js 
[
  { id: 1, firstName: 'Guillaume', location: 'San Francisco' },
  { id: 5, firstName: 'Serena', location: 'San Francisco' }
]
bob@dylan:~$
